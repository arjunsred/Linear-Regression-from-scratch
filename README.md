This is my first linear regression in python. Linear regression
helps in prediction and forecasting. It can provide new insights
to businesses and is valuable. The type of linear regression
I created is simple linear regression. It took many weeks just to learn the
fundamentals of simple linear regression.I wrote the whole code from
scratch even without the help of third party libraries.
